\section{Blackbox Validation}

On the first hand i am running a bunch of experiments according to the DOE
exposed on the previous assignment.

After running the different experiments I got the following results of each
transaction runner that are under \textbf{simulation.csv}.

After doing an \textbf{ANOVA} analysis with the real data of the marathon we
have obtain a very low \textit{p-value} which indicates that the populations are quite
different.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c|c|  }
    \hline
    \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{ANOVA Results from R Studio} \\
    \hline
    & Df & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F Value & Pr(>F) & \\
    \hline
    x2 & 1 & 38383319841 & 38383319841 & 10458 & $<2e^{16}$ & *** \\
    Residuals & 7198 & 26417268633 & 3670085 & & & \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \captionof{figure}{ANOVA Analysis between simulation and real marathon data}
  \label{table:anova}
\end{table}

Also we can see the bloxplot resulting on this ANOVA and how the means of both
populations differ, although not so much.

\subsection{Conclusion Blackbox validation}
According to the results we must \textbf{reject the null hypothesis} reaching to
the conclusion that the simulation is not so well adjusted to generate values
near to the real data.

In the context of this Assignment I am not going to adjust the simulation, but
I can assure that if we observe the Plot the means don't diverge so much and
adding more randomness could solve the problem.
